## Introduction

A gimbal is a device that lets you shoot smooth video by canceling out unwanted camera movements. They come in many shapes and sizes, from tiny ones with integrated cameras to heavy-duty
devices for DSLRs or film cameras, often mounted on drones or cranes.

OpenGimbal can be all of those! The philosophy behind OpenGimbal is to make every single part customizable and extensible for your own needs.
The provided designs allow you to get started with a small but powerful smartphone gimbal in a few hours, but you can always adapt them to your own needs.

OpenGimbal is not just handy for gimbals, though. Grab included designs and firmware for brushless motor controllers and make anything you want move!
